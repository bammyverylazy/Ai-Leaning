# ASL Isolated Sign Recognition
### MediaPipe Holistic landmarks + BiGRU / BiLSTM classifier (webcam prototype)

An educational prototype that watches a short video (or webcam clip) of one American Sign Language (ASL) sign and predicts **which of 50 words** it is, with a **confidence score**, and answers **"not sure"** when confidence is low.

> This is a study prototype. It is **not** a communication tool for Deaf or hard-of-hearing people.

## 1. The idea in one minute

A computer does not "see" a hand like a human. A video is millions of colored pixels. Learning directly from pixels needs a lot of data and is easily confused by lighting, background and clothing.

So we split the problem in two:

```
 VIDEO ──► [Stage 1: find the body]  ──► sequence of coordinates ──► [Stage 2: understand the motion] ──► WORD + confidence
            MediaPipe (pre-trained)        (numbers only)             BiGRU / BiLSTM (we train this)
```

- **Stage 1 (pose detection)** turns every frame into a list of points: knuckles, fingertips, wrists, shoulders, mouth corners, eyebrows. Background, skin tone and clothes disappear. Only geometry remains.
- **Stage 2 (sign interpretation)** reads the sequence of those points over time and decides which sign it is.

The two stages are kept clearly separate: you can change or inspect each one without touching the other.

---

## 2. Scope

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Sign language | ASL | Chosen target; large public dataset exists |
| Task | **Isolated** sign recognition (one word per clip) | Continuous sentence translation is a much harder, separate problem |
| Vocabulary | 50 words | Enough examples per word; expandable to 100 |
| Inputs | Hands + upper body + face subset | Signs use handshape, location, movement **and** facial expression |
| Output | Top-3 words, confidence, "not sure" option | Wrong-but-confident answers are worse than admitting uncertainty |
| Device | Windows laptop + webcam | Target for the demo and latency tests |

## 4. Models used

There are exactly **two** model stages.

### 4.1 MediaPipe Holistic Landmarker (pre-trained, by Google, not trained by us)
- Input: one image frame. Output: landmark coordinates.
- Internally a bundle of smaller models: pose (BlazePose), face mesh, palm detection + hand landmarks.
- Full output is 553 landmarks (33 pose + 478 face + 21 per hand). **We keep 98.**
- Runs in `VIDEO` mode, which tracks across frames and needs strictly increasing timestamps.
- Model file: `holistic_landmarker.task` (float16).

### 4.2 BiGRU / BiLSTM sequence classifier (trained by us)
- Input: 64 frames × 590 features. Output: 50 class scores.
- We train **GRU** and **LSTM** versions and compare them (same architecture otherwise).

### What about Ultralytics / YOLO?
Suggested as an option. Standard YOLO-pose gives **17 body keypoints only: no fingers, no detailed face**, but ASL words are distinguished mainly by handshape. So it is not the main extractor. It could be an optional ablation. Note it is licensed AGPL-3.0, which matters if the project ever becomes commercial.

---

## 5. Data

**ASL Citizen** (Microsoft Research, Boston University, University of Washington)
- 83,399 videos, 2,731 signs, 52 signers (Deaf / hard-of-hearing), recorded on the contributors' own cameras with consent, which is close to real webcam conditions.
- Official splits are by **signer**.

**Our subset**
- 50 words with the most training examples from the words with enough examples in all splits (minimum 15 train, 3 val, 8 test).
- Videos kept: train 950, val 191, test 729 (1,870 total). At least 18 training videos per word.
- Test set contains 11 signers the model never saw during training.
- Signer overlap between train/val/test is checked automatically and must be 0.

**Why split by signer (data leakage)**
If the same person appears in training and test, the model can memorize *that person's* style and look accurate while failing on anyone new. Splitting by signer measures what we actually care about: *does it work for a new person?*

---

## 6. Step-by-step: what each script does

| Script | What it does | Key idea |
|---|---|---|
| `config.py` | Paths, which landmark indices to keep, sequence length (64) | One place to change settings |
| `download_model.py` | Downloads `holistic_landmarker.task` | Model file for Stage 1 |
| `fetch_subset.py` | Reads the zip's file list remotely and extracts only needed files (HTTP range requests) | Avoids a 42.8 GB download |
| `make_vocab.py` | Reads the split CSVs, picks 50 words, writes `vocab.txt` + `subset_*.csv`, checks signer overlap | Reproducible vocabulary |
| `extract.py` | Runs MediaPipe on every frame, saves `[T, 98, 3]` per video, logs hand-detection ratio | Slowest step; parallel and resumable |
| `dataset.py` | Cleans, normalizes, resamples, builds features, defines augmentation and the PyTorch `Dataset` | Turns raw points into learnable input |
| `model.py` | Defines the BiGRU/BiLSTM classifier | Stage 2 |
| `train.py` | Trains, picks best epoch on validation, evaluates on test, writes reports | Honest evaluation |
| `application.py`, `demo.py` | Unified Demo/Testing desktop interface and camera workflow | User-facing application |
| `speech.py` | Asynchronous offline Windows SAPI speech for committed subtitle entries | Speech feedback |

### The 98 selected points (`config.py`)
- **Pose: 13** (nose, eyes, ears, mouth corners, shoulders, elbows, wrists)
- **Left hand: 21**, **right hand: 21** (wrist, thumb, 4 fingers × 4 joints)
- **Face: 43** (mouth 20, eyebrows 10, eyes 8, nose tip 1, face outline 4)

Coordinates are `(x, y, z)`. `x, y` are normalized to the image (0–1); `z` is relative depth.

### Why `NaN` and not `0` for missing points
If a hand is hidden, MediaPipe returns nothing. Writing `0` would claim "the hand is at the image corner", which is a real position and would teach the model a lie. `NaN` means "unknown" and is handled explicitly (interpolation, plus a "hand present" flag as a feature).

---

## 7. The classifier in detail

### Why a sequence model?
A sign is **motion over time**. A single frame rarely tells you the word; the trajectory does. So we need a model that reads frames **in order** and remembers the past.

### RNN, LSTM, GRU
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):** processes one time step at a time and passes a "hidden state" (its memory) to the next step. Plain RNNs forget long-range information (the *vanishing gradient* problem).
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** adds **gates** that learn what to *forget*, what to *store*, and what to *output*, plus a separate long-term **cell state**. Better at keeping important information across many frames.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** a simpler cousin with fewer gates (update and reset) and no separate cell state. Fewer parameters, trains faster, often performs similarly.
- **Bidirectional (Bi):** two RNNs, one reading forward and one backward, and their outputs are joined, so every frame has context from both before and after.

Analogy: watching a clip while taking notes. LSTM/GRU decide which notes to keep, rewrite or throw away; at the end you decide the word from the notes.

### Our layers
1. `Linear(590→192) + LayerNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)`: compress and rescale each frame's features.
2. `BiGRU/BiLSTM`, 2 layers, hidden size 192: read the sequence.
3. **Mean pooling + max pooling over time:** mean = overall motion; max = the strongest moments. Concatenated → 768 numbers.
4. `Dropout → Linear(768→50)`: one score (logit) per word.
5. `softmax`: turn scores into probabilities.

---

## 8. Training and evaluation

### Training setup
| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Loss | Cross-entropy with **label smoothing 0.1** |
| Optimizer | **AdamW**, lr 1e-3, weight decay 1e-2 |
| LR schedule | Cosine annealing |
| Batch size / epochs | 64 / up to 60 |
| Regularization | Dropout 0.3, weight decay, gradient clipping (1.0), augmentation |
| Early stopping | Patience 12 on validation accuracy; keeps best checkpoint |
| Seeds | Set via `--seed`; repeat with several seeds and report mean ± std |

### Augmentation (training set only)
Time warping (speed changes), rotation ±10°, scale 0.9–1.1, small shifts, small Gaussian noise. These imitate different speeds, camera tilt and distance. Mirroring is **not** used (it would swap left/right hands).

### Metrics (computed on the unseen-signer test set)
- **Top-1 accuracy:** correct word is the first guess.
- **Top-5 accuracy:** correct word is in the five best guesses.
- **Macro-F1:** F1 per word, averaged equally, so easy words cannot hide hard ones.
- **Confusion matrix:** rows = true word, columns = predicted word. Off-diagonal cells show which signs get mixed up.
- **Per-signer accuracy:** shows whether some people are much harder than others.
- **Latency:** milliseconds for landmarks and for classification, measured in the demo.

### Train / validation / test roles
- **Train:** the model learns from it.
- **Validation:** used to choose the best epoch and the confidence threshold.
- **Test:** touched once at the end; the honest score on new people.

### Overfitting
When training loss keeps falling but validation loss/accuracy stops improving or worsens, the model is memorizing rather than generalizing. With only about 15 videos per word, this is a real risk. Countermeasures: augmentation, dropout, weight decay, early stopping, a small model.

---

## 9. The "not sure" mechanism

1. The softmax gives a probability for every word; the highest is the **confidence**.
2. On the **validation** set, `train.py` searches for the smallest threshold where the answers kept are at least 90% accurate while still answering at least 50% of clips.
3. If no threshold satisfies this, the threshold is 0 (no rejection). Check `reports/*_metrics.json`.
4. On test, we report **coverage** (fraction answered) and **accuracy on the answered part**.
5. In the demo, confidence below the threshold shows **NOT SURE**.

Softmax confidence is only a rough signal and can still be wrong on unusual inputs. It is not a guarantee.

---

## 10. Unified desktop application

Run the app from the `project` folder. The main window has a top-right mode selector for **Demo** (free practice) and **Testing** (guided attempts). The camera preview is embedded in the application, and only one webcam/recognition worker can run at a time.

```powershell
python src\demo.py --ckpt models\gru_seed3.pt
python src\demo.py --mode testing --ckpt models\gru_seed3.pt
```

In Demo mode, choose **Start camera** to see a live preview and continuous sign recognition. Stabilized signs are added to the subtitle; **Clear** clears the current subtitle, and the sound toggle only affects speech. `Ctrl+L` also clears the subtitle. The image shown is mirrored for the user, while the unmirrored camera frame is used for recognition to preserve training orientation.

Speech uses the computer's installed Windows **System.Speech/SAPI** English voice locally and works without an internet connection. Only a newly stabilized sign that has been added to the subtitle is queued for speech. Words are spoken one at a time in a background worker; muting, clearing the subtitle, switching modes, or closing the app cancels queued speech. If PowerShell or an enabled English voice is unavailable, the app reports the problem and continues recognition and subtitles without speech.

### Guided testing

Testing mode is a page in the same application. Choose a verified target, replay its embedded reference video as needed, then select **Start attempt**. The webcam opens in the adjacent preview and the attempt starts explicitly; finish it to display the prediction and confidence and save its metadata. Attempts remain unverified until an independent reviewer records ground truth. If a target is changed while a camera is active, stop that camera first; switching away during an active test asks before discarding the unfinished attempt.

Demonstrations are intentionally managed separately from the ASL Citizen training videos:

- Add reviewed MP4/H.264 files under `data/sign_demos/videos/<LABEL>/`.
- Fill that label's placeholder row in `data/sign_demos/manifest.csv` with the exact checkpoint label, a unique `video_id`, a version, the MP4 `filename`, its `source`, `verification_status=verified`, the independently checked `verified_meaning`, reviewer `notes`, and `is_current=true`.
- Keep old versioned files and rows when replacing a video: mark the previous row `is_current=false` and add a new current row. Use a clear frontal view with the hands and relevant upper body visible. Use MP4/H.264; the file must be decodable by the installed OpenCV build.
- The runtime checks that a video opens and contains readable frames. The runtime will not treat raw training clips as demonstrations. Missing, unverified, or corrupted videos are listed in `reports/missing_sign_demos.csv`, and cannot be assigned as a test target. In the app, use **Open missing-demo list** to inspect labels still awaiting clips.

At present, **none of the 50 labels has a curated, verified demonstration video**. ASL Citizen clips exist as labeled training examples, but have not been reviewed as teaching references. The full missing-label list is in `reports/missing_sign_demos.csv`.

Start the app in guided testing mode, or select Testing from Demo mode:

```powershell
python src\demo.py --mode testing --ckpt models\gru_seed3.pt
python src\demo.py --mode testing --ckpt models\gru_seed3.pt --target AXE1
```

`--target` selects an initial label only when that label has a verified, readable demonstration video. If no verified demos are available, Testing mode explains why and links to the missing-demo report; Demo mode remains available for webcam practice.

Each completed webcam attempt is stored in `data/recognition_attempts.sqlite3`. Target, canonical prediction, original checkpoint label/class index, top-3 scores, model SHA-256, preprocessing version, inference latency, demo watched duration, session ID, and timestamp are recorded separately. Ground truth remains empty and correctness remains `unverified` until an independent reviewer supplies it. Existing databases are migrated without deleting prior attempts:

```powershell
python src\manage_attempts.py pending
python src\manage_attempts.py verify --attempt-id 1 --ground-truth AXE1 --verified-by reviewer_id
python src\manage_attempts.py correct --attempt-id 1 --ground-truth DOG1 --verified-by reviewer_id --reason "Second independent review"
python src\manage_attempts.py history --attempt-id 1
```

Corrections append an audit record and preserve the original model prediction. The correctness status is computed from the reviewed ground truth and prediction, never by assuming that the target is ground truth or that a matching prediction proves the performed sign was correct. Canonical display labels do not change checkpoint vocabulary order or class indices: only metadata-confirmed aliases such as `WHATFOR1/2/3` are combined; labels with distinct sign identities keep their suffix as a visible variant.

Error analysis checklist: the most confused word pairs (`*_top_confusions.csv`), why (similar handshape? same location? hand occluded?), accuracy per signer, accuracy versus hand-detection ratio.

For context only: the ASL Citizen paper reports about 63% accuracy over **all 2,731 signs**. That is a different, harder task than 50 words, so the numbers are not directly comparable.

## 15. Limitations

- **Little data per word** (about 15 training videos), so results can vary a lot between runs.
- **Isolated signs only**; you press a key to mark start and end. No continuous translation.
- **Landmark errors** from poor light, motion blur, strong angles, hands covering the face or each other, or fast fingers.
- **Domain gap:** dataset recording conditions differ from your own webcam setup.
- **Signer differences:** speed, style, dominant hand, regional variation.
- **Sign language is more than hands:** meaning can depend on facial expression, body shifts and context; we use only a subset of face points.
- **Confidence is approximate.**
- **No evaluation with Deaf signers** beyond the dataset; the system has not been validated for real communication.
- **Dataset terms apply:** check the ASL Citizen license before any use beyond study (it is released for non-commercial research).

## 16. Future work

- More words and more data per word.
- Other architectures: 1D-CNN, small Transformer, graph networks on the skeleton.
- Compare other extractors (e.g. Ultralytics hand-keypoint models) as an ablation.
- Automatic start/end detection of a sign.
- Continuous sign recognition and then translation.
- Evaluate with Deaf signers and involve the community in design decisions.
- Export to ONNX / mobile for on-device use.

## 17. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `fetch_subset.py : not recognized` | Run it with Python: `python src/fetch_subset.py list` |
| `pip install mediapipe` fails | Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 |
| Model file not found | Run `python src/download_model.py` or download the link and place it in `models\` |
| `MISSING ATTRIBUTE` in `--probe` | MediaPipe output names differ; send the printed output to adjust `result_to_array` |
| Extraction very slow or PC freezes | Lower `--workers` to 2 |
| `No such file ... landmarks` in `dataset.py` | Extraction not finished; rerun `extract.py` (skips finished files) |
| Very few samples kept | Lower `--min-hand-ratio` and check `data/landmarks/_quality.csv` |
| Camera does not open | Try `--camera 1`; close other apps using the camera |
| Poor webcam accuracy but good test accuracy | Domain gap: improve lighting, distance, plain background; sign at similar speed |
| Everything is "NOT SURE" | Threshold too high for your setup; try `--thr 0.3` and check hand detection |
